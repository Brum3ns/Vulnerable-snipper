[Desciption]

The code checks if the username is "admin" should be the only user that is allowed to add new comments.


[Issue]

The code do use the function "strtolower()". This means if a user register a new account with the 
username as "ADMIN" that do not have the privileges. The user is still able to add a new comment
and the filter is bypassed.
