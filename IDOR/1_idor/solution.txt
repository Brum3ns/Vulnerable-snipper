[1_IDOR]

Description:

The issue is that the if statment do check with "==" and not "&&".
The diffierent. This means if both is "true" or "false" in either way
it will give premission.

Issue:
Using "==" instead of "&&" in the IF statment. With one "a" function
checking the other "b" function which execute "a" inside "b" and always
leave both return values into "true"/"false".
