[1_SQLi]

Description:

This script connect to the backend databse and it's purpose is to change the username inside the profile page.
It first checks the username "id" by user input. and run a SQL statment to extract the current username for that user.

Issue:

Payload: sleep(1) 
> Will sleep "x" row that is in the table. At "line 24".


The issue is that neighter user input is filtered. If you infect the "id" when it's reading the user input. It do not
convert the "id" variable into an (int) type or filter it. This makes it possible to get access to the database fully.
