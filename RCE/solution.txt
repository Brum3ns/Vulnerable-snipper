[1_RCE]

Payload: $(whoami)

Description:
The file tries to filter almost all specia chars but forgot "(", ")", "$". It then read the input from the user.
The user is only suppose to run the "ls" command to see content.

Issue:

Because the file uses "os.system()" instead of a custom function that would be much more secure.
It's possible to take advantage of the system CLI syntax. Therefore "$(<command>)" works because it will execute
a command inside itself even if the core command "ls" gets an error. Which leads to remote code execution (RCE).
