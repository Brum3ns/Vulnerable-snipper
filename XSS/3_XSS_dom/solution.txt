[Description]

The code use the "s" query to search on the client side for results with the "collect()" function.

[Issue]

The "s" query is filtered "decent" in the backend since it delete <,>," but the variable in the Javascript code uses ' to filter it's value.
It's then passed "document.write()". This function just like HTML tries to auto correct this by replacing the client side view to make it 
look like it's isolated by double quotes ("). 

This is in fact wrong since it's isolated by a single qoute ('). This means that a payload like: x'onmouseover=alert(1)//
Will execute it even if it looks like it's isolated with (") but in fact isen't. (Firefox browser - Newest version)

[Payload]
x'onmouseover=alert(1)//
