# Vulnerable-snipper
Vulnerable snipper to learn how the backend can be manupulated by user input.
> All of this files is vulnerable. do **NOT** use similar code when programming.

## Description
This files contains different files that give an example how bugs can accure in the backend systems and what type of code style that is used.
Every script uses parse input for example to make it easy to play around with in the CLI without setting up a local server.
**Example:**
```
vulnerable.py "input"
```
Where **Vulnerable.py** is the vulnerable code and **input** is the user input to demonstraight a GET/POST request inside the CLI.
*It's important to use the quotes otherwise your taking advantage of the CLI futures which you shoulden't. Since we focus on the vulnerable code snipper not a way to *manupulate* the terminal syntax itself.*

## Install
