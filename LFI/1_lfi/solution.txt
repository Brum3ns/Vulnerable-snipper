Payload: secret%252fsecret

Description:

The payload works because the file decodes the user input valid two times. but only checks the first.

Issue:

The filter url decode the valid and check for slashes and dots. but it won't see does if it's double url encoded.
Therefore the filter sees "%2f" but before it execute open() it decode it once again and sees "/".
