[1_passwordReset.php]

[Description]
The code check for a valid email and generate a token to preform a reset link to recover the password. However it do take the
'Host header' value from the request. This makes it possible to hijack the link inside the mail that is later sent to the user.

[Issue]
The code is vulnerable to 'Host header injection' that leads to reset link manupulation. If the attack is successfully and the
user clicks on the reset link and then change hes/her password. It is then given to the leaked to the attackers.
